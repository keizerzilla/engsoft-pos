abstract = {In this study, a fully automatic pose and expression invariant 3D face
alignment algorithm is proposed to handle frontal and profile face
images which is based on a two pass course to fine alignment strategy.
The first pass of the algorithm coarsely aligns the face images to an
intrinsic coordinate system (ICS) through a single 3D rotation and the
second pass aligns them at fine level using a minimum nose tip-scanner
distance (MNSD) approach. For facial recognition, multi-view faces are
synthesized to exploit real 3D information and test the efficacy of the
proposed system. Due to optimal separating hyper plane (OSH), Support
Vector Machine (SVM) is employed in multi-view face verification (FV)
task. In addition, a multi stage unified classifier based face
identification (FI) algorithm is employed which combines results from
seven base classifiers, two parallel face recognition algorithms and an
exponential rank combiner, all in a hierarchical manner. The performance
figures of the proposed methodology are corroborated by extensive
experiments performed on four benchmark datasets: GavabDB, Bosphorus,
UMB-DB and FRGC v2.0. Results show mark improvement in alignment
accuracy and recognition rates. Moreover, a computational complexity
analysis has been carried out for the proposed algorithm which reveals
its superiority in terms of computational efficiency as well.},

more attention in biometrics research area. In recent years, the
countermeasures based on the texture and depth image against spoofing
mask attacks have been reported, but the research based on 3D meshed
sample has not been studied yet. In this paper, we propose to apply 3D
shape analysis based on principal curvature measures to describe the
meshed facial surface. Meanwhile, a verification protocol based on this
feature descriptor is designed to verify person identity and to evaluate
the anti-spoofing performance on Morpho database. Furthermore, for
simulating a real-life testing scenario, FRGCv2 database is enrolled as
an extension of face scans to augment the ratio of genuine face samples
to fraud mask samples. The experimental results show that our system can
guarantee a high verification rate for genuine faces and the
satisfactory anti-spoofing performance against spoofing mask attacks in

abstract = {This paper presents the integration of a multiple people detection and identification system with a dynamic simultaneous localization and mapping system for an autonomous robotic platform. This integration allows the exploration and navigation of the robot considering people identification. The robotic platform consists of a Pioneer 3DX robot equipped with an RGBD camera, a Sick Lms200 sensor laser and a computer using the robot operating system (ROS). The idea is to integrate the people detection and identification system to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system of the robot using ROS. The people detection and identification system is performed in two steps. The first one is for detecting multiple people on scene and the other one is for an individual person identification. Both steps are implemented as ROS nodes that works integrated with the SLAM ROS node. The multiple people detection's node uses a manual feature extraction technique based on HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) detectors, implemented using the PCL library (Point Cloud Library) in C ++. The person's identification node is based on a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that are implemented using the MatLab MatConvNet library. This step receives the detected people centroid from the previous step and performs the classification of a specific person. After that, the desired person centroid is send to the SLAM node, that consider it during the mapping process. Tests were made objecting the evaluation of accurateness in the people's detection and identification process. It allowed us to evaluate the people detection system during the navigation and exploration of the robot, considering the real time interaction of people recognition in a semi-structured environment.},

abstract = {The potential of the nasal region for expression robust 3D face recognition is thoroughly investigated by a novel five-step algorithm. First, the nose tip location is coarsely detected and the face is segmented, aligned and the nasal region cropped. Then, a very accurate and consistent nasal landmarking algorithm detects seven keypoints on the nasal region. In the third step, a feature extraction algorithm based on the surface normals of Gabor-wavelet filtered depth maps is utilised and, then, a set of spherical patches and curves are localised over the nasal region to provide the feature descriptors. The last step applies a genetic algorithm-based feature selector to detect the most stable patches and curves over different facial expressions. The algorithm provides the highest reported nasal region-based recognition ranks on the FRGC, Bosphorus and BU-3DFE datasets. The results are comparable with, and in many cases better than, many state-of-the-art 3D face recognition algorithms, which use the whole facial domain. The proposed method does not rely on sophisticated alignment or denoising steps, is very robust when only one sample per subject is used in the gallery, and does not require a training step for the landmarking algorithm. https://github.com/mehryaragha/NoseBiometrics},

Then, a filtering process is performed by implanting our 3D Gabor-Edge technique extended based on the classic 3D Gabor masks. The next step is to achieve the classification of facial features from the edge saliency by the artificial Neural Network Classifier (NNC).

abstract = {Pose variations are still challenging problems in 3D face recognition because large pose variations will cause self-occlusion and result in missing data. In this paper, a new method for pose-invariant 3D face recognition is proposed to handle significant pose variations. For pose estimation and registration, a coarse-to-fine strategy is proposed to detect landmarks under large yaw variations. At the coarse search step, candidate landmarks are detected using HK curvature analysis and subdivided according to a facial geometrical structure-based classification strategy. At the fine search step, candidate landmarks are identified and labeled by comparing with a Facial Landmark Model. By using the half face matching, we perform the matching step with respect to frontal scans and side scans. Experiments carried out on the Bosphorus and UND/FRGC v2.0 databases show that our method has high accuracy and robustness to pose variations.},

abstract = {Face recognition remains a challenge today as recognition performance is strongly affected by variability such as illumination, expressions and poses. In this work we apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the challenging task of both 2D and 3D face recognition. We constructed two CNN models, namely CNN-1 (two convolutional layers) and CNN-2 (one convolutional layer) for testing on 2D and 3D dataset. A comprehensive parametric study of two CNN models on face recognition is represented in which different combinations of activation function, learning rate and filter size are investigated. We find that CNN-2 has a better accuracy performance on both 2D and 3D face recognition. Our experimental results show that an accuracy of 85.15{\%} was accomplished using CNN-2 on depth images with FRGCv2.0 dataset (4950 images with 557 objectives). An accuracy of 95{\%} was achieved using CNN-2 on 2D raw image with the AT{\&}T dataset (400 images with 40 objectives). The results indicate that the proposed CNN model is capable to handle complex information from facial images in different dimensions. These results provide valuable insights into further application of CNN on 3D face recognition.},

Moreover, one individual can only provide one sample for training in most practical scenarios, and thus the face recognition with single sample problem is another highly challenging task. We propose an efficient framework for 3D partial face recognition with single sample addressing both of the two problems. First, we represent a facial scan with a set of keypoint based local geometrical descriptors, which gains sufficient robustness to partial facial data along with expression/pose variations. Then, a two-step modified collaborative representation classification scheme is proposed to address the single sample recognition problem. A class-based probability estimation is given during the first classification step, and the obtained result is then incorporated into the modified collaborative representation classification as a locality constraint to improve its classification performance. Extensive experiments on the Bosphorus and FRGC v2.0 datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach when addressing the problem of 3D partial face recognition with single sample.},

abstract = {Face and facial attributes represent meaningful definition about a variety of information to discriminate an individual from others and for developing a computational model for automatic face recognition purpose. However, in this work, selection of relevant features from newly created face space is the pivotal contribution of the authors. Here, authors have demonstrated a new face space 'Complement Component' that have been used to extract the four basic components along X, and Y axes in four directions. Later, authors have experimented the discriminative attributes from these face spaces for recognition purpose. Here, comparison of the proposed method has been reported by examining its success on two well accepted 3D face databases, namely: Frav3D and Texas3D. In case of 2D face images, it does not contain depth like information i.e. Z-values in X-Y plane through intensity values. Therefore, it has not been undertaken during this investigation.},

abstract = {In last years, the emergence of 3D shape in face recognition is due to its robustness to pose and illumination changes. These attractive benefits are not all the challenges to achieve satisfactory recognition rate. Other challenges such as facial expressions and computing time of matching algorithms remain to be explored. In this context, we propose our 3D face recognition approach using 3D wavelet networks. Our approach contains two stages: learning stage and recognition stage. For the training we propose a novel algorithm based on 3D fast wavelet transform. From 3D coordinates of the face (x,y,z), we proceed to voxelization to get a 3D volume which will be decomposed by 3D fast wavelet transform and modeled after that with a wavelet network, then their associated weights are considered as vector features to represent each training face. For the recognition stage, an unknown identity face is projected on all the training WN to obtain a new vector features after every projection. A similarity score is computed between the old and the obtained vector features. To show the efficiency of our approach, experimental results were performed on all the FRGC v.2 benchmark.},

In addition, motivated by the fact that a single classifier cannot be generally efficient against all face regions, a two tier ensemble classifier based 3D face recognition approach is presented which employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and Mahalanobis Cosine (MahCos) matching score for classification of facial regions with weighted Borda Count (WBC) based combination and a re-ranking stage. The performance of proposed approach is corroborated by extensive experiments performed on two databases: GavabDB and FRGC v2.0, confirming effectiveness of fusion strategies to improve performance.},

The algorithm is initialized with a subset of anthropometric landmarks detected by our proposed Deep Landmark Identification Network which is trained on synthetic images. The landmarks are used to segment the 3D face into Voronoi regions by evolving geodesic level set curves. Exploiting the intrinsic features of these regions, we extract discriminative keypoints on the facial manifold to elastically match the regions across faces for establishing dense correspondence. Finally, we generate a Region based 3D Deformable Model which is fitted to unseen faces to transfer the correspondences. We evaluate our algorithm on the tasks of facial landmark detection and recognition using two benchmark datasets. Comparison with thirteen state-of-the-art techniques shows the efficacy of our algorithm.},

The proposed method uses the Surfaces Empirical Mode Decomposition (SEMD), facial curves and local shape descriptor in a matching process to overcome the distortions caused by expressions in faces. The basic idea is that, the face is presented at different scales by SEMD. Then the isometric-invariant features on each scale are extracted. After that, the geometric information is obtained on the 3D surface in terms of radial and level facial curves. Finally, the feature vectors on each scale are associated with their corresponding geometric information. The presented method is validated on GavabDB database resulting a rank 1 recognition rate (RR) of 98.9{\%} for all faces with neutral and non-neutral expressions. This result outperforms other 3D expression-invariant face recognition methods on the same database.},

abstract = {Extracting efficient features from the large volume of 3D facial data directly is extremely difficult in 3D face recognition (3D-FR) with the latest methods, which mostly require heavy computations and manual processing steps. This paper presents a computationally efficient 3D-FR system based on a novel Frenet frame-based feature that is derived from the 3D facial iso-geodesic curves. In terms of the evaluation of the proposed method, we conducted a number of experiments on the CASIA 3D face database, and a superior recognition performance has been achieved. The performance evaluation suggests that the pose invariance attribute of the features relieves the need of an expensive 3D face registration in the face preprocessing procedure, where we take less time to process conversely. Our experiments further demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves competitive recognition performance when compared with some existing techniques for 3D-FR, but also is computationally efficient.},

approximate 180 degree information of face is acquired, and the data
used to identify individual is obtained from a random single view. Pure
face is extracted from 3D data first, then convert the original data to
the form of spherical depth map (SDM) and spherical texture map (STM),
which are invariant to out-plane rotation, subsequently facilitating the
successive alignment-free identification that is robust to pose

well performance with the two maps. Experiments show that our proposed

The nature of face exhibits non-linear shapes due to appearance deformations, and face variations presented by facial expressions. Recognizing faces reliably across changes in facial expression has proved to be a more difficult problem leading to low recognition rates in many face recognition experiments. This is mainly due to the tens degree-of-freedom in a non-linear space. Recently, non-linear PCA has been revived as it posed a significant advantage for data representation in high dimensionality space. In this paper, we experimented the use of non-linear kernel approach in 3D face recognition and the results of the recognition rates have shown that the kernel method outperformed the standard PCA.},

abstract = {3D face recognition is a popular research area due to its vast application in biometrics and security. Local featurebased methods gain importance in the recent years due to their robustness under degradation conditions. In this paper, a novel high-order local pattern descriptor in combination with sparse representation based classifier (SRC) is proposed for expression robust 3D face recognition. 3D point clouds are converted to depth maps after preprocessing. Multi-directional derivatives are applied in spatial space to encode the depth maps based on the local derivative pattern (LDP) scheme. Directional pattern features are calculated according to local derivative variations. Since LDP computes spatial relationship of neighbors in a local region, it extracts distinct information from the depth map. Multiscale depth-LDP is presented as a novel descriptor for 3D face recognition. The descriptor is employed along with the SRC to increase the range data distinctiveness. A histogram on the derivative pattern creates a spatial feature descriptor that represents the distinctive micro-patterns from 3D data. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on two famous 3D face databases, FRGC v2.0 and Bosphorus. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves acceptable performance under facial expression.},

Most of the face detector techniques could be classified into feature based methods and image based also. Feature based techniques adds low-level analysis, feature analysis, etc. Facial recognition is a system capable of verifying / identifying a human after 3D images. By evaluating selected facial unique features from the image and face dataset. Design from transformation method given vector dimensional illustration of individual face in a prepared set of images, Principle component analysis inclines to search a dimensional sub-space whose normal vector features correspond to the maximum variance direction in the real image space. The PCA algorithm evaluates the feature extraction, data, i.e. Eigen Values and vectors of the scatter matrix. In literature survey, Face recognition is a design recognition mission performed exactly on faces. It can be described as categorizing a facial either “known” or “unknown”, after comparing it with deposits known individuals. It is also necessary to need a system that has the capability of knowledge to recognize indefinite faces. Computational representations of facial recognition must statement various difficult issues. After existing work, we study the SIFT structures for the gratitude method. The novel technique is compared with well settled facial recognition methods, name component analysis and eigenvalues and vector. This algorithm is called PCA and ICA (Independent Component Analysis). In research work, we implement the novel approach to detect the face in minimum time and evaluate the better accuracy based on Back Propagation Neural Networks. We design the framework in face recognition using MATLAB 2013a simulation tool.

abstract = {Deep networks trained on millions of facial images are believed to be closely approaching human-level performance in face recognition. However, open world face recognition still remains a challenge. Although, 3D face recognition has an inherent edge over its 2D counterpart, it has not benefited from the recent developments in deep learning due to the unavailability of large training as well as large test datasets. Recognition accuracies have already saturated on existing 3D face datasets due to their small gallery sizes. Unlike 2D photographs, 3D facial scans cannot be sourced from the web causing a bottleneck in the development of deep 3D face recognition networks and datasets. In this backdrop, we propose a method for generating a large corpus of labeled 3D face identities and their multiple instances for training and a protocol for merging the most challenging existing 3D datasets for testing. We also propose the first deep CNN model designed specifically for 3D face recognition and trained on 3.1 Million 3D facial scans of 100K identities. Our test dataset comprises 1,853 identities with a single 3D scan in the gallery and another 31K scans as probes, which is several orders of magnitude larger than existing ones. Without fine tuning on this dataset, our network already outperforms state of the art face recognition by over 10{\%}. We fine tune our network on the gallery set to perform end-to-end large scale 3D face recognition which further improves accuracy. Finally, we show the efficacy of our method for the open world face recognition problem.},

abstract = {This study proposes a 3D face recognition method using multiple subject-specific curves insensitive to intra-subject distortions caused by expression variations. Considering that most sharp variances in facial convex regions are closely related to the bone structure, the convex crest curves are first extracted as the most vital subject-specific facial curves based on the principal curvature extrema in convex local surfaces. Then, the central profile curve and the horizontal contour curve passing through the nose tip are detected by using the precise localization of the nose tip and symmetry plane. Based on their discriminative power and robustness to expression changes, the three types of curves are fused with appropriate weights at the feature-level and used for matching 3D faces with the iterative closest point algorithm. The combination of multiple expression-insensitive curves is complementary and provides sufficient and stable facial surface features for face recognition. In addition, for each convex crest curve, an expression-irrelevant factor is assigned as the adaptive weight to improve the face matching performance. The results of experiments using two public 3D databases, GavabDB and BU-3DFE, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and its recognition rates on both databases reflect an encouraging performance.},

In the feature extraction method, we exploit curve concept to represent the 3D facial data, two types of curves was considered: depth-level and depth-radial curves. As the dimension of the obtained features is high, the problem 'curse of dimensionality' appears. To solve this problem, the Random Projection (RP) method was used. The proposed classifier performs Fuzzification operation using triangular membership functions for input data and ordered weighted averaging operators to measure similarity. Experiment was conducted using vrml files from 3D Database considering only one training sample per person. The obtained results are very promising for depth-level and depth-radial curves, besides the recognition rates are higher than 98{\%}.},

abstract = {Recognition of faces typically occurs via holistic processing where individual features are combined to provide an overall facial representation. However, when faces are inverted, there is greater reliance on featural processing where faces are recognized based on their individual features. These findings are based on a substantial number of studies using 2-dimensional (2D) faces and it is unknown whether these results can be extended to 3-dimensional (3D) faces, which have more depth information that is absent in the typical 2D stimuli used in face recognition literature. The current study used the face inversion paradigm as a means to investigate how holistic and featural processing are differentially influenced by 2D and 3D faces. Twenty-five participants completed a delayed face-matching task consisting of upright and inverted faces that were presented as both 2D and 3D stereoscopic images. Recognition accuracy was significantly higher for 3D upright faces compared to 2D upright faces, providing support that the enriched visual information in 3D stereoscopic images facilitates holistic processing that is essential for the recognition of upright faces. Typical face inversion effects were also obtained, regardless of whether the faces were presented in 2D or 3D. Moreover, recognition performances for 2D inverted and 3D inverted faces did not differ. Taken together, these results demonstrated that 3D stereoscopic effects influence face recognition during holistic processing but not during featural processing. Our findings therefore provide a novel perspective that furthers our understanding of face recognition mechanisms, shedding light on how the integration of stereoscopic information in 3D faces influences face recognition processes.},

abstract = {3D face recognition with the availability of only partial data (missing parts, occlusions and data corruptions) and single training sample is a highly challenging task. This paper presents an efficient 3D face recognition approach to address this challenge. We represent a facial scan with a set of local Keypoint-based Multiple Triangle Statistics (KMTS), which is robust to partial facial data, large facial expressions and pose variations. To address the single sample problem, we then propose a Two-Phase Weighted Collaborative Representation Classification (TPWCRC) framework. A class-based probability estimation is first calculated based on the extracted local descriptors as a prior knowledge. The resulting class-based probability estimation is then incorporated into the proposed classification framework as a locality constraint to further enhance its discriminating power. Experimental results on six challenging 3D facial datasets show that the proposed KMTS-TPWCRC framework achieves promising results for human face recognition with missing parts, occlusions, data corruptions, expressions and pose variations.},

abstract = {3D face recognition holds great promise in achieving robustness to pose, expressions and occlusions. However, 3D face recognition algorithms are still far behind their 2D counterparts due to the lack of large-scale datasets. We present a model based algorithm for 3D face recognition and test its performance by combining two large public datasets of 3D faces. We propose a Fully Convolutional Deep Network (FCDN) to initialize our algorithm. Reliable seed points are then extracted from each 3D face by evolving level set curves with a single curvature dependent adaptive speed function. We then establish dense correspondence between the faces in the training set by matching the surface around the seed points on a template face to the ones on the target faces. A morphable model is then fitted to probe faces and face recognition is performed by matching the parameters of the probe and gallery faces. Our algorithm achieves state of the art landmark localization results. Face recognition results on the combined FRGCv2 and Bosphorus datasets show that our method is effective in recognizing query faces with real world variations in pose and expression, and with occlusion and missing data despite a huge gallery. Comparing results of individual and combined datasets show that the recognition accuracy drops when the size of the gallery increases.},

First, the eyes, nose, and mouth feature regions are extracted by the Anthropometric characteristics and curvature features of the human face. Second, Curvelet energy features of the facial feature regions at different scales and different directions are extracted by Curvelet transform. At last, Euclidean distance is used as the similarity between template and objectives. To verify the performance, the proposed algorithm is compared with Anthroface3D and Curveletface3D on the Texas 3D FR database. The experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm performs well, with equal error rate of 1.75{\%} and accuracy of 97.0{\%}.

In this paper, a threshold facial region of an image is detected and preprocessing is done based through the image excellence. If the selected face is frontal face with good lighting, extract the prerequisite features and do the necessary comparison steps to recognize the faces. In case, if the selected face is in bad lighting, then perform histogram equalization and normalization to increase the contrast. Different Poses and expressions are the very challenging zones which require surplus pre-processing to improve the performance of the face recognition system. Hence an enhanced normalization method called 3D Morphable Model are used as a pre- processing technique to create a frontal view from a non-frontal view and also merge images with different views in to a single frontal view. Next to diminish the number of features used for recognition process; we emulate the linear discriminant analysis method for further classification.

abstract = {3D face similarity is a critical issue in computer vision, computer graphics and face recognition and so on. Since Fr{\'{e}}chet distance is an effective metric for measuring curve similarity, a novel 3D face similarity measure method based on Fr{\'{e}}chet distances of geodesics is proposed in this paper. In our method, the surface similarity between two 3D faces is measured by the similarity between two sets of 3D curves on them. Due to the intrinsic property of geodesics, we select geodesics as the comparison curves. Firstly, the geodesics on each 3D facial model emanating from the nose tip point are extracted in the same initial direction with equal angular increment. Secondly, the Fr{\'{e}}chet distances between the two sets of geodesics on the two compared facial models are computed. At last, the similarity between the two facial models is computed based on the Fr{\'{e}}chet distances of the geodesics obtained in the second step. We verify our method both theoretically and practically. In theory, we prove that the similarity of our method satisfies three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and triangle inequality. And in practice, experiments are conducted on the open 3D face database GavaDB, Texas 3D Face Recognition database, and our 3D face database. After the comparison with iso-geodesic and Hausdorff distance method, the results illustrate that our method has good discrimination ability and can not only identify the facial models of the same person, but also distinguish the facial models of any two different persons.},

abstract = {A novel adaptive feature selection based on reconstruction residual and accurately located landmarks for expression-robust 3D face recognition is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the novel facial coarse-to-fine landmarks localization method based on Active Shape Model and Gabor wavelets transformation is proposed to exactly and automatically locate facial landmarks in range image. Secondly, the multi-scale fusion of the pyramid local binary patterns (F-PLBP) based on the irregular segmentation associated with the located landmarks is proposed to extract the discriminative feature. Thirdly, a sparse representation-based classifier based on the adaptive feature selection (A-SRC) using the distribution of the reconstruction residual is presented to select the expression-robust feature and identify the faces. Finally, the experimental evaluation based on FRGC v2.0 indicates that the adaptive feature selection method using F-PLBP combined with the A-SRC can obtain the high recognition accuracy by performing the higher discriminative power to overcome the influence from the facial expression variations.},

abstract = {Techniques of 2D–3D superimposition are widely used in cases of personal identification from video surveillance systems. However, the progressive improvement of 3D image acquisition technology will enable operators to perform also 3D–3D facial superimposition. This study aims at analyzing the possible applications of 3D–3D superimposition to personal identification, although from a theoretical point of view. Twenty subjects underwent a facial 3D scan by stereophotogrammetry twice at different time periods. Scans were superimposed two by two according to nine landmarks, and root-mean-square (RMS) value of point-to-point distances was calculated. When the two superimposed models belonged to the same individual, RMS value was 2.10 mm, while it was 4.47 mm in mismatches with a statistically significant difference (p {\textless} 0.0001). This experiment shows the potential of 3D–3D superimposition: Further studies are needed to ascertain technical limits which may occur in practice and to improve methods useful in the forensic practice.},

abstract = {The first handicap in 3D faces recognizing under unconstrained problem is the largest variability of the visual aspect when we use various sources. This great variability complicates the task of identifying persons from their 3D facial scans and it is the most reason that bring to face detection and recognition of the major problems in pattern recognition fields, biometrics and computer vision. We propose a new 3D face identification and recognition method based on Gappy Wavelet Neural Network (GWNN) that is able to provide better accuracy in the presence of facial occlusions. The proposed approach consists of three steps: the first step is face detection. The second step is to identify and remove occlusions. Occluded regions detection is done by considering that occlusions can be defined as local face deformations. These deformations are detected by a comparison between the input facial test wavelet coefficients and wavelet coefficients of generic face model formed by the mean data base faces. They are beneficial for neighborhood relationships between pixels rotation, dilation and translation invariant. Then, occluded regions are refined by removing wavelet coefficient above a certain threshold. Finally, the last stage of processing and retrieving is made based on wavelet neural network to recognize and to restore 3D occluded regions that gathers the most. The experimental results on this challenging database demonstrate that the proposed approach improves recognition rate performance from 93.57 to 99.45 {\%} which represents a competitive result compared to the state of the art.},

abstract = {Face recognition in an uncontrolled condition such as illumination and expression variations is a challenging task. Local descriptor is one of the most efficient methods used to deal with these problems. In this paper, we present an automatic 3D face recognition approach based on three local descriptors, local phase quantization (LPQ), Three-Patch Local Binary Patterns (TPLBP) and Four-Patch Local Binary Patterns (TPLBP). Facial images are passing through one of the three descriptors and divided into sub-regions or rectangular blocks. The histogram of each sub-region is extracted and concatenated into a single feature vector. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and EFM (Enhanced Fisher linear discriminant Model) are used to reduce the dimensionality of the resulting feature vectors. Finally, these vectors are sent to the classification step, when we use two methods; SVM (Support Victor Machine) and similarity measures. CASIA 3D face database is introduced to experimental evaluation. The experimental results illustrate a high recognition performance of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {The classical curvatures of smooth surfaces (Gaussian, mean and
principal curvatures) have been widely used in 3D face recognition (FR).
However, facial surfaces resulting from 3D sensors are discrete meshes.
In this paper, we present a general framework and define three principal
curvatures on discrete surfaces for the purpose of 3D FR. These
principal curvatures are derived from the construction of asymptotic
cones associated to any Borel subset of the discrete surface. They
describe the local geometry of the underlying mesh. First two of them
correspond to the classical principal curvatures in the smooth case. We
isolate the third principal curvature that carries out meaningful
geometric shape information. The three principal curvatures in different
Borel subsets scales give multi-scale local facial surface descriptors.
We combine the proposed principal curvatures with the LNP-based facial
descriptor and SRC for recognition. The identification and verification
experiments demonstrate the practicability and accuracy of the third
principal curvature and the fusion of multi-scale Borel subset
descriptors on 3D face from FRGC v2.0.},

abstract = {Feature selection from facial regions is a well-known approach to increase the performance of 2D image-based face recognition systems. In case of 3D modality, the approach of region-based feature selection for face recognition is relatively new. In this context, this paper presents an approach to evaluate the discrimination power of different regions of a 3D facial surface for its potential use in face recognition systems. We propose the use of weighted average of unit normal vector on the facial surface as the feature for region-based face recognition from 3D point cloud data (PCD). The iterative closest point algorithm is employed for the registration of segmented regions of facial point clouds. A metric based on angular distance between normals is introduced to indicate the similarity between two surfaces of same facial region. Finally, the intra class correlation based discrimination score is formulated to find out the key facial regions such as the eyes, nose, and mouth that are significant while recognizing a person with facial surface PCD.},

abstract = {Due to the difficulties associated with the collection of 3D samples, 3D face recognition technologies often have to work with smaller than desirable sample sizes. With the aim of enlarging the training number for each subject, we divide each training image into several patches. However, this immediately introduces two further problems for 3D models: high computational cost and dispersive features caused by the divided 3D image patches. We therefore first map 3D face images into 2D depth images, which greatly reduces the dimension of the samples. Though the depth images retain most of the robust features of 3D images, such as pose and illumination invariance, they lose many discriminative features of the original 3D samples. In this study, we propose a Bayesian learning framework to extract the discriminative features from the depth images. Specifically, we concentrate the features of the intra-class patches to a mean feature by maximizing the multivariate Gaussian likelihood function, and, simultaneously, enlarge the distances between the inter-class mean features by maximizing the exponential priori distribution of the mean features. For classification, we use the nearest neighbor classifier combined with the Mahalanobis distance to calculate the distance between the features of the test image and items in the training set. Experiments on two widely-used 3D face databases demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed method compared to relevant state-of-the-art methods.},

In the very first step, seven significant facial landmarks are identified on the face. Secondly, six distinct triangular regions A to F are created on the face using any three individual landmarks where nose tip is common to all regions. Further 3D volumes of all the respective triangular regions have been calculated based on plane fitting on the input range images. Finally, KNN and SVM classifiers are considered for classification. Initially, the classification and recognition are carried out on the different volumetric region, and a further combination of all the regions is considered. The proposed approach is tested on three useful challenging databases, namely Frav3D, Bosphorous, and GavabDB.},

abstract = {This paper presents a straight-forward yet efficient, and expression-robust 3D face recognition approach by explor- ing location sensitive sparse representation of deep normal patterns (DNP). In particular, given raw 3D facial surfaces, we first run 3D face pre-processing pipeline, including nose tip detection, face region cropping, and pose normaliza- tion. The 3D coordinates of each normalized 3D facial sur- face are then projected into 2D plane to generate geometry images, from which three images of facial surface normal components are estimated. Each normal image is then fed into a pre-trained deep face net to generate deep represen- tations of facial surface normals, i.e., deep normal pattern- s. Considering the importance of different facial locations, we propose a location sensitive sparse representation clas- sifier (LS-SRC) for similarity measure among deep normal patterns associated with different 3D faces. Finally, sim- ple score-level fusion of different normal components are used for the final decision. The proposed approach achieves significantly high performance, and reporting rank-one s- cores of 98.01{\%}, 97.60{\%}, and 96.13{\%} on the FRGC v2.0, Bosphorus, and BU-3DFE databases when only one sam- ple per subject is used in the gallery.

abstract = {We propose a novel method for measuring the nasal similarity among 3D faces. Firstly, we construct a representation for the nose shape, which is composed of a set of geodesic curves, each crosses the bridge of the nose. Next, using these geodesic curves, we formulate a similarity measure to compare among noses in the curve shape space. Under the Riemannian framework, the shape space is a quotient space for which the scaling, translation and rotation are removed. Since the nose similarity measure is based on the shape comparison, the proposed method has the following advantages: (1) the similarity measure is robust to facial expressions since the nose is not affected by facial expressions; (2) the geometric features of the nose shape match well with the human perception; (3) the similarity measure is independent of the mesh grid because the chosen nose curves are not sensitive to the triangular mesh model. We construct a nasal hierarchical structure for noses organization which is based on nose similarity measure results. In our experiments, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with competing methods on three public face databases namely, FRGC2.0, Texas3D and BosphorusDB. The results show superiority of the proposed method in terms of both the speed and the accuracy when the nasal measurements are processed in the nasal hierarchical structure and the nasal samples with low sampling rate (5{\%}-25{\%} of original point cloud).},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel descriptor based on the local derivative pattern (LDP) for 3D face recognition. Compared to the local binary pattern (LBP), LDP can capture more detailed information by encoding directional pattern features. It is based on the local derivative variations that extract high-order local information. We propose a novel discriminative facial shape descriptor, local normal derivative pattern (LNDP) that extracts LDP from the surface normal. Using surface normal, the orientation of a surface at each point is determined as a first-order surface differential. Three normal component images are extracted by estimating three components of normal vectors in x, y, and z channels. Each normal component is divided into several patches and encoded using LDP. The final descriptor is created by concatenating histograms of the LNDP on each patch. Experimental results on two famous 3D face databases, FRGC v2.0 and Bosphorus illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed descriptor.},

abstract = {With the increasing availability of low-cost 3D data acquisition devices, the use of 3D face data for the recognition of individuals is becoming more appealing and computationally feasible. This paper proposes a completely automatic algorithm for face registration and matching. The algorithm is based on the extraction of stable 3D facial features characterizing the face and the subsequent construction of a signature manifold. The facial features are extracted by performing a continuous-to-discrete scale-space analysis. Registration is driven from the matching of triplets of feature points and the registration error is computed as shape matching score. Conversely to most techniques in the literature, a major advantage of the proposed method is that no data pre-processing is required. Therefore all presented results have been obtained exclusively from the raw data available from the 3D acquisition device. The method has been tested on the Bosphorus 3D face database and the performances compared to the ICP baseline algorithm. Even in presence of noise in the data, the algorithm proved to be very robust and reported identification performances which are aligned to the current state of the art, but without requiring any pre-processing of the raw data.},

abstract = {3D face recognition and emotion analysis play important roles in many fields of communication and edutainment. An effective facial descriptor, with higher discriminating capability for face recognition and higher descriptiveness for facial emotion analysis, is a challenging issue. However, in the practical applications, the descriptiveness and discrimination are independent and contradictory to each other. 3D facial data provide a promising way to balance these two aspects. In this paper, a robust regional bounding spherical descriptor (RBSR) is proposed to facilitate 3D face recognition and emotion analysis. In our framework, we first segment a group of regions on each 3D facial point cloud by shape index and spherical bands on the human face. Then the corresponding facial areas are projected to regional bounding spheres to obtain our regional descriptor. Finally, a regional and global regression mapping (RGRM) technique is employed to the weighted regional descriptor for boosting the classification accuracy. Three largest available databases, FRGC v2, CASIA and BU-3DFE, are contributed to the performance comparison and the experimental results show a consistently better performance for 3D face recognition and emotion analysis.},

abstract = {We propose an unsupervised online learning method based on the “growing neural gas” algorithm (GNG), for a data-stream configuration where each incoming data is visited only once and used to incrementally update the learned model as soon as it is available. The method maintains a model as a dynamically evolving graph topology of data-representatives that we call neurons. Unlike usual incremental learning methods, it avoids the sensitivity to initialization parameters by using an adaptive parameter-free distance threshold to produce new neurons. More-over, the proposed method performs a merging process which uses a distance-based probabilistic criterion to eventually merge neurons. This allows the algorithm to preserve a good computational efficiency over infinite time. Experiments on different real datasets, show that the proposed method is competitive with existing algorithms of the same family, while being independent of sensitive parameters and being able to maintain fewer neurons, which makes it convenient for learning from infinite data-streams.},

abstract = {This paper presents a local feature based shape matching algorithm for expression-invariant 3D face recognition. Each 3D face is first automatically detected from a raw 3D data and normalized to achieve pose invariance. The 3D face is then represented by a set of keypoints and their associated local feature descriptors to achieve robustness to expression variations. During face recognition, a probe face is compared against each gallery face using both local feature matching and 3D point cloud registration. The number of feature matches, the average distance of matched features, and the number of closest point pairs after registration are used to measure the similarity between two 3D faces. These similarity metrics are then fused to obtain the final results. The proposed algorithm has been tested on the FRGC v2 benchmark and a high recognition performance has been achieved. It obtained the state-of-the-art results by achieving an overall rank-1 identification rate of 97.0{\%} and an average verification rate of 99.01{\%} at 0.001 false acceptance rate for all faces with neutral and non-neutral expressions. Further, the robustness of our algorithm under different occlusions has been demonstrated on the Bosphorus dataset.},

abstract = {Expression, occlusion, and pose variations are three main challenges for 3D face recognition. A novel method is presented to address 3D face recognition using scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features on 3D meshes. After preprocessing, shape index extrema on the 3D facial surface are selected as keypoints in the difference scale space and the unstable keypoints are removed after two screening steps. Then, a local coordinate system for each keypoint is established by principal component analysis (PCA). Next, two local geometric features are extracted around each keypoint through the local coordinate system. Additionally, the features are augmented by the symmetrization according to the approximate left-right symmetry in human face. The proposed method is evaluated on the Bosphorus, BU-3DFE, and Gavab databases, respectively. Good results are achieved on these three datasets. As a result, the proposed method proves robust to facial expression variations, partial external occlusions and large pose changes.},

abstract = {Face recognition has broad excitement in the latest trend in image processing. Face recognition refers to identify a specific individual in digital image by analyzing and comparing patterns. It has numerous benefits which attract every sector but there are some issues such as more time consumption and lesser accuracy which degrade the user services. To solve this problem we proposed a highly accurate and fast method to reduce the execution time. The proposed method uses average half face approach because overall system's accuracy is better in it rather than using the original full face image. The proposed method can be used to recognize both 2D and 3D images. It mainly includes the average half face creation, feature detection, full face recognition through average half face using distance metrics and finally checking system's accuracy along with time consumption. The proposed method is based on eye, nose and mouth detection.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on a region based methodology for expression in sensitive 3D face recognition process. Considering facial regions that are comparatively unchanging during expressions, results shows that using fifteen sub regions on the face can attain high 3D face recognition. We use a modified face recognition algorithm along with hierarchical contour based image registration for finding the similarity score. Our method operates in two modes: verification mode and confirmation mode. Crop 100 mm of frontal face region, apply preprocessing and automatically detect nose tip, translate the face image to origin and crop fifteen sub regions. The cropped sub regions are defined by cuboids which occupy more volumetric data, Nose Tip is the most projecting point of the face with the highest value along Z-axis so consider it as origin. The modified face recognition algorithm reduces the effects caused by facial expressions and artifacts. Finally a Hierarchical contour based image registration technique is applied which yields better results. The approach is applied on Bosphorus 3D datasets and achieved a verification rate of 95.3{\%} at 0.1{\%} false acceptance rate. In the identification scenario 99.3{\%} rank one recognition is achieved.},

abstract = {In this work, we take advantage of the superiority of Spectral Graph Theory in classification application and propose a novel deep learning framework for face analysis which is called Spectral Regression Discriminant Analysis Network (SRDANet). Our SRDANet model shares the same basic architecture of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which comprises three basic components: convolutional filter layer, nonlinear processing layer and feature pooling layer. While it is different from traditional deep learning network that in our convolutional layer, we extract the leading eigenvectors from patches in facial image which are used as filter kernels instead of randomly initializing kernels and update them by stochastic gradient descent (SGD). And the output of all cascaded convolutional filter layers is used as the input of nonlinear processing layer. In the following nonlinear processing layer, we use hashing method for nonlinear processing. In feature pooling layer, the block-based histograms are employed to pooling output features instead of max-pooling technique. At last, the output of feature pooling layer is considered as one final feature output of our model. Different from the previous single-task research for face analysis, our proposed approach demonstrates an excellent performance in face recognition and expression recognition with 2D/3D facial images simultaneously. Extensive experiments conducted on many different face analysis databases demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed SRDANet model. Databases such as Extended Yale B, PIE, ORL are used for 2D face recognition, FRGC v2 is used for 3D face recognition and BU-3DFE is used for 3D expression recognition.},

abstract = {Expression change is the major cause of local plastic deformation of the facial surface. The intra-class differences with large expression change somehow are larger than the inter-class differences as it's difficult to distinguish the same individual with facial expression change. In this paper, an expression-robust 3D face recognition method is proposed by learning expression deformation model. The expression of the individuals on the training set is modeled by principal component analysis, the main components are retained to construct the facial deformation model. For the test 3D face, the shape difference between the test and the neutral face in training set is used for reconstructing the expression change by the constructed deformation model. The reconstruction residual error is used for face recognition. The average recognition rate on GavabDB and self-built database reaches 85.1{\%} and 83{\%}, respectively, which shows strong robustness for expression changes.},
